Push signing allows Git servers to guarantee that a particular client updated a branch or tag to point to a particular commit This can be used for example to trace the origin of malicious code that has made its way into a repository Roughly speaking the signing process that introduces our vulnerability works as follows The client invokes git push signed kicking off the client server git protocol negotiation The server responds with the set of capabilities that it supports If the server supports signed pushes it will include push cert lt nonce gt The nonce in this case being a securely generated random string known only to the server The client sends a push certificate containing the pusher an identifier for the client s GPG key
the pushee the URL of the repository
the nonce
one or more create update or delete operations to be performed on branches or tags
a GPG signature of all of the above generated using the client s private key The server verifies the signature using the user s public key typically stored in the repository and accepts the push So did you spot the problem It s pretty subtle The nonce
The nonce is used to prevent a particular man in the middle MITM technique known as a replay attack The server specifies a different nonce value at the
beginning of each push process and will only continue when the client supplies a signed version of that nonce The problem lies in the fact that the server specifies the nonce value to be used If you re familiar with other authentication systems that use nonces for example OAuth you might be used to the client generating a random nonce This is not the case with the Git protocol The reason a server generated nonce is problematic in this case is that a malicious server can use this mechanism to force a client to sign any arbitrary value that fits into a nonce with their private key And it turns out the Git pack protocol is very loose when it comes to what values you can use as a nonce Most modern Git clients will accept as a nonce any collection of bytes that is less than kb and
doesn t contain the null character tabs spaces or newlines For example if I initiate a git push signed a malicious server could respond with the capability push cert quot Please wire from my account to XXX XXXX XXX Sincerely kannonboy quot And my Git client would automatically sign it with my private key and send it back to the server This is something that only I should be able to wilfully do and observers for example my bank could believe that I had authored or at least ratified the signed statement Of course the underscores look a bit weird And the nonce is embedded in a push certificate so there would be a bunch of junk in it that would tip off my bank before they forked over the cash I hope To illustrate the signed push request would look something like push cert side band k

However some binary file formats are very forgiving about the format of a file Jann Horn the security researcher who first reported the vulnerability pointed out that PDF files are particularly problematic If you replace all n with r and all spaces with f in a PDF file then add lines above and below the PDF file most PDF readers e g evince and xpdf will still treat it as a valid PDF file So if the server had craftily encoded the request for as a PDF and passed it as the nonce value they would end up with a signed PDF that my bank would be much more likely to fall for The solution
The vulnerability has been fixed by limiting the nonce size to bytes and whitelisting the allowed characters a zA Z It s believed this will restrict the nonce content to the point where an attacker will be unable to force the client to produce a signed file of any exploitable value Why you don t need to worry
Once again it s hard to label this issue a vulnerability as the threat of exposure is so low You can t use this technique to make malicious changes to the repository as the ref operations specified in the pack protocol are rigidly defined It is only exploitable in that it can be used to generate signatures for content that fits into a nonce and even then the signed content will contain push certificate cruft that will look very suspicious to most consumers In the fraudulent bank transfer above the looseness of the PDF specification is arguably just as much to blame as the nonce In addition to this limitation the attacker must have full control the Git server that the user is pushing to in order to exploit the problem Or somehow spoof the server via MITM which is difficult as most Git servers will be protected by TLS particularly those frequented by Git users who sign their pushes While this vulnerability is a neat trick and a fun hypothetical exploit your Git servers and bank accounts are probably safe for the time being However there is a slightly more important take away for developers who dabble in security if you re ever programmatically using GPG keys don t sign arbitrary data from third parties Keep an eye on kannonboy for further musings about programming git and developer tools The title of this post is borrowed from Mike Gerwitz s excellent paper illustrating why tag commit and push signing are valuable practices for security minded professionals Latest developer blog posts GorillaStack x s serverless HipChat Connect boilerplate Elliott Spira guest author June nd in AWS Add ons HipChat Hyperlinking logs to source code Ian Buchanan June th in Bitbucket APIs Developing a JIRA add on like it x s Part Two Andreas Knecht guest author June th in JIRA Add ons JIRA EAP Now Available Steve Haffenden June th in JIRA Aui APIs Early Access Program Developing a JIRA add on like it x s Andreas Knecht guest author June th in JIRA Add ons From beta to GA How to build a winning API Tanguy Crusson June th in APIs All developer blog posts feed To stay up to date on developer topics subscribe to our feed and join our mailing list Get developer updates var aa config aa config aa config linkname A git horror story faking provenance with a loose nonce Help us improve Report a problem with this page var disqus shortname atlassiandevelopers window disqus identifier blog git horror story loose nonces window disqus url https developer atlassian com blog git horror story loose nonces window disqus title A git horror story faking provenance with a loose nonce View the discussion thread Atlassian adroll adv id VYBYAQRHLDDVMBEAGU adroll pix id QSSDXNANETSAUFGF function var oldonload window onload window onload function adroll loaded true var scr document createElement script var host https document location protocol https s adroll com http a adroll com scr setAttribute async true scr type text javascript scr src host j roundtrip js document getElementsByTagName head null document getElementsByTagName script parentNode appendChildscr if oldonload oldonload
