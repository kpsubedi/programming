nginx s default polling mechanism simply doesn t recognise connections that have been redirected and never triggers the event loop For the first of these I wrote this patch Given accept and accept are equivalent enough for our purposes this patch just pushes accept to the intercepted accept Update floyd ch points out this patch is more correct than my original one diff git a src desock c b src desock c
