[Organizing Larger Programs]
- covering more of Python's techniques for organizing programs.
- looking at Python's concept of packages and how these can be used to add structure to your program as it grows beyond simple modules.

[[ Packages ]]
- Python's basic tool for organizing code is the _module_. A module typically corresponds to a single source file, and you load modules into programs by using the **import** keyword. 
- When you import a module, it is represented by an object of type **module** and you can interact with it like any other object.
- A _package_ in Python is just a special type of module.
